# saïgon nonce for 10.3


## Who made this?
The 3 exploits(triple_fetch+ziva+extra_recipe) were made by Ian Beer, Adam Donenfeld, and Luca Todesco.

(Abraham Masri @cheesecakeufo) have compiled them into one.

/u/Siguza made a comment on reddit to combine phœnixnonce with this. I did just that.

@coffeebreakerz also found a respring bug. I have implemented that too ;)

## More info

The latest build will have a run.log file attached. This is to see differences and/or debug things.

The latest build causes a kernel panic at this time.
